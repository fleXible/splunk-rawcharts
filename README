Introduction
------------
This app enables users to leverage Splunk's data mining capabilities and RAW's
project interface for generating D3 charts right from Splunk web GUI.

What's D3?
D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3's emphasis on web
standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying
yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components
and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

What's RAW project?
RAW is an open web tool developed at the DensityDesign Research Lab (Politecnico
di Milano) to create custom vector-based visualizations on top of D3.js.

Primarily conceived as a tool for designers and vis geeks, RAW aims at providing
a missing link between spreadsheet applications and vector graphics editors.
